# odin-recipes

WIth this Project im going to learn how to create a basic multipage website in html.
It's gonna be a Recipe site with list items describing each step of preparing it.
I've learned how to add ordered and unordered lists, images with headings and paragraphs.
Then i pushed my work onto my githup repo.
